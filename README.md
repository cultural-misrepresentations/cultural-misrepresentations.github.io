# Cultural Misrepresentations in AI

A research project examining cultural bias and misrepresentation in Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 🌍 Project Overview

This repository contains research findings and data from our study on how AI language models represent diverse cultures. We systematically analyze AI-generated content to identify patterns of cultural misrepresentation, stereotyping, and bias across different geographic and cultural contexts.

## 📊 Study Scope

- **6 Regions Studied** across India
- **100+ Annotations** of AI-generated cultural content
- **Multi-category Analysis** of misrepresentation types

### Studied Locations

- Bengaluru, Karnataka
- Guwahati, Assam
- Imphal-East, Manipur
- Kasaragod, Kerala
- Kolkata, West Bengal
- Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu

## 🔍 Research Focus

We examine several types of cultural misrepresentations:

1. **Cultural Inaccuracies**: Factual errors about customs and traditions
2. **Stereotyping**: Oversimplified cultural portrayals
3. **Linguistic Errors**: Misuse of regional languages
4. **Logical Inconsistencies**: Scenarios that don't align with cultural realities
5. **Improbable Scenarios**: Unrealistic cultural depictions
